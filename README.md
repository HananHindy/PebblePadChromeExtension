# PebblePad Chrome Extension for Workbooks with Multiple Pages

This extension is meant to work with PebblePad workbooks with multiple workbooks and pages.

## How it works
The extension works on visualising the workbook in a SunBurst chart (Copyright (c) 2017 Vasco Asturiano) that links back to the workbook.
